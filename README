Name: Josh Levey

Programming Background: I've taken CS-106, a basic webdesign class that provided a general overview of HTML, CSS and Javascript. We also reviewed a little bit of JQuery. 
I also took CS-206, Building Web Applications, a python-based server side web application course. 
I've been teaching myself a little bit of python but I am still on the beginner level.

What you hope to get from the course: I really hope that I'm able to get into this course, as I'm currently on the waitlist. I hope that in taking this course I'll have a basic understanding of the Python coding language and that 
I'll be through taking this I'll be able to design and implement programs of my own.
